# Documentation

* Documentation should say how to build the project

It should, as mentioned, be one command, and it should not depend on very much
set up beyond "having a standard development workstation."

* Documentation should say how to run the project

What flags or configuration does it take? How do you tell it to re-read
the configuration? Does it use any environment variables?

* Documentation should be discoverable

It should either be in the `README.md` of the relevant repo or linked
to directly from there.
