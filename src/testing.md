# Testing

* Have tests in the repo

This is related to CI. I'm not going to go into how to write tests and test
coverage and all of that here; that's again a separate topic for many
many books. But there should be tests, and the important tests should
be in the repo, and they should automatically be run by CI.

Remember: Tests aren't just a tool for making sure the developers didn't
mess up after a fact. They're there so developers can make sweeping
changes with confidence.
