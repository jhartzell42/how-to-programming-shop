# Ticket Systems

* Make sure it's not too hard to make a ticket

It should be *very easy* to add a new TODO item that the programmer
doesn't have to remember anymore. If it takes too long to make a ticket,
developers will lose their flow on the project they were trying to work
on, or will produce fewer tickets, in a bad way.

Ideal is "type a single sentence and press a single button" either in
web or (preferably) command line. The resultant TODO items can then be
fleshed out in a separate grooming meeting.
