# Development Environment

* Let programmers use their own preferred development environment

Many developers have life-long habits and long-accumulated configurations
for their favorite editors. I know I do! Standardizing IDEs or even
operating systems can be tempting, but in general it isn't worth
it. Programming includes a lot of little steps, and making all of them
take longer by changing a programmer's environment can destroy momentum.

* Provide standards for developer workstations

This might seem to contradict the previous point, but I honestly think you
need both. It should be super easy to figure out what kind of operating
system requirements and dependencies are necessary to build all the
projects, because, as we'll get to soon, developers should be able to
build projects locally.

For example, most Linux distributions are customizable enough that
programmers will be able to find a development environment within that
distribution that suits them. The dependencies of a project can then be
specified as a package list within that distribution, but the developers
can then customize the rest of their interface. Commonly used distributions
should be preferred if developers are doing their own IT, so that they
can easily find help online.
