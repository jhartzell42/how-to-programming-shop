* Revise in blog post on Napoleon
    * Worked-out example of bad documentation
        * Turn it into good documentation
            * In multiple steps, write the lede
            * Good documentation is already in there
        * About a protocol?
            * Describes all the wire formats
            * Never describes what the wire format is for
    * Discuss why people don't list the lede stuff
        * People write notes for themselves
            * They write down the things they're likely to forget
            * Lede information you are very unlikely to forget
            * Details you are very likely to forget
        * However, the things they do write down are not as important to write
            * Details can be found from the code
                * Details are more likely to be redundant to the code
                    * Redundant = drift
* Figure out where to put "reproducibility"
* How to teach (especially programming)
    * Teaching is different from documentation
        * Based off of Yocto training experience
    * Simplification doesn't require "babying" terminology
        * Not even for programming
            * "Filing cabinet"
                * Mention Cornell explicitly
                * The baby terminology took on all the complexity
                * And provides none of the benefit
                * SMBC voltage armidillos
        * Use the real terminology
            * You have to be willing to explain it
            * Maybe use a different term once to introduce
            * But then get them talking like a pro as soon as possible
    * Don't just do example projects
        * Might as well have people just start in at work then
        * Choose homework projects well
    * Actually teach theory
        * Concepts that are obvious to you aren't obvious to others
        * e.g. Yocto (call back) explain what Yocto's goals are
            * Yocto commands can then be explained relative to its goals
            * The example projects can then be chosen relative to its goals
* Go revise each section
* Discuss Foundation Team
* Discuss hiring dev-ops professionals
* Discuss On-Call
