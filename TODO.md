    * Don't just do example projects
        * Might as well have people just start in at work then
        * Choose homework projects well
    * Actually teach theory
        * Concepts that are obvious to you aren't obvious to others
        * e.g. Yocto (call back) explain what Yocto's goals are
            * Yocto commands can then be explained relative to its goals
            * The example projects can then be chosen relative to its goals
* Go revise each section
    * Consider making it less of a check-list
    * Consider doubling down on check-list-ism
